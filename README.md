# Title: Building a Resilient LAMP Stack on AWS with CloudFormation and Auto Scaling
We will Provision the infrastructure and Host a highly available & scalable LAMP(Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) Stack over the AWS cloud using the Infrastructure as a code (IAC) service named CloudFormation.

# Project Overview
Created a CloudFormation template to Deploy a highly available & scalable LAMP Stack over AWS where servers will be launched by ASG and the traffic on the application will be handled by ALB(Application Load Balancer).

Also, the Metrics of the server should be monitored by CloudWatch and get the state of the stack via email notification using Amazon SNS.
